# INTRUSION DETECTION SYSTEM(HIDS & NIDS)

HIDS(Host-Based Intrusion Detection Sytem): Monitors individual host systems for suspicious activity, detecting unusual behaviors or patterns indicative of security breaches or attempted attacks.HIDS systems operate on individual host systems, a host could be a server, a PC, or any other type of device that produces logs, metrics, and other data that can be monitored for security purposes.
NIDS(Network-based Intrusion Detection System): Analyzes network traffic for signs of malicious activity, identifying potential security breaches and attacks on a system including sniffers and attacks on services such as HTTP/S, SMB, SSH etc.

## Project Overview: 
The growing complexity of computer networks and the increasing number of applications running on them have exacerbated the risk of network security breaches. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role in safeguarding against these threats by monitoring network traffic for suspicious activity. This project aims to develop an IDS using deep learning techniques, specifically leveraging TensorFlow's Sequential Dense and Dropout layers. By employing deep learning methodologies, I seek to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of intrusion detection, thereby strengthening network security in real-time environments.

### Objectives:

Design and implement an Intrusion Detection System using TensorFlow's Sequential model with Dense and Dropout layers following Fran√ßois Chollet's architecture for Part 1 layers in Deep Learning With Python
Train the model on labeled network traffic data to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior.
Evaluate the performance of the IDS in terms of detection accuracy and false-negative rates.
Problem Statement:

The proliferation of cyber threats poses a significant challenge to the security of computer networks. Malicious activities such as malware infections, phishing attacks, and denial-of-service intrusions threaten the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data. Traditional intrusion detection methods often struggle to keep pace with evolving threats, leading to gaps in network defenses and vulnerabilities. By harnessing the power of deep learning, I aim to develop a more robust and adaptive IDS capable of identifying complex patterns indicative of network attacks.
